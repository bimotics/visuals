<p>But as dashboard guru  <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com">Steven Few</a> has frequently pointed out, needle gauge indicators are not an efficient use of screen real estate.  A more efficient way to display a value within an expected range and indicate a target value is to use a simple horizontal bullet bar.</p>



<p>This renders the following:<br />
<img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bhs&chs=150x30&chd=t:70&chm=r,ff0000,0,0.0,0.5|r,ffff00,0,0.5,0.75|r,00A000,0,0.75,1.0|r,000000,0,0.8,0.81&chco=000000&chbh=10" alt="Bullet Bar"/></p>

<p>In the second example the chart type is bar horizontal (bhs) and there are four chart markers (chm) within the bar.  The first marker is red, the second is yellow and the third is green.</p>

<p>The first marker is the red bar that extends 50% of the bar's distance <br />
The second marker is the yellow line that extends from .5 to .75 <br />
The third marker the green line that extends from .75 to the end of the bar <br />
We can also draw a short vertical black bar to indicate our target value of .81<br />
Finally, the overall height of the entire bar is controlled by the chart bar height parameter chbh=10</p>
